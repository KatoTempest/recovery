# Building recovery online made easy #

## Important notice ##
### Users reported build errors forking to own account. ###
### To fix this, create a new organization, fork to the new organization. This fixes the problem, for now.

#### What this is ####

This is an easy way for recovery maintainers or anyone who's interested in building recoveries to finish their dream without a server.
